# CS412 Dark System – Performance Innovative Task

Interactive Fortnite-inspired shop prototype that contrasts dark pattern purchasing flows with an ethical, user-protective experience. The project was built for our CS412 Performance Innovative Task to demonstrate how UI decisions influence player spending behavior.

## 🌀 Experience Overview
- **Dark Pattern Mode** – Instant-purchase flow that skips confirmation, flashes congratulatory messaging, and encourages impulse buys.
- **Ethical Mode** – Adds friction via a confirmation modal, hold-to-confirm mechanic, and clear balance impact before completing a purchase.
- **Responsive Item Grid** – Featured and Daily rotations, rarity styling, and quick-purchase badges for each cosmetic.
- **Rich Feedback** – Celebration modal for dark mode, secure modal for ethical mode, and toast notifications for errors or confirmations.
- **Local Asset Bundle** – Uses bundled `.webp` renders under `src/images/` for reliable offline demos.
